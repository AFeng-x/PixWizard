## 🛠️ Install 

1. Clone this repository and navigate to PixWizard folder
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/AFeng-x/PixWizard.git
cd PixWizard
```
2. nvcc Check

Before installation, ensure that you have a working ``nvcc``

```bash
# The command should work and show the same version number as in our case. (12.1 in our case).
nvcc --version
```

On some outdated distros (e.g., CentOS 7), you may also want to check that a late enough version of
``gcc`` is available

```bash
# The command should work and show a version of at least 6.0.
# If not, consult distro-specific tutorials to obtain a newer version or build manually.
gcc --version
```

3. Install packages

``` bash
# Create a new conda environment named 'PixWizard
conda create -n PixWizard -y
# Activate the 'sphinx-v' environment
conda activate PixWizard
# Install python and pytorch
conda install python=3.11 pytorch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y
# Install required packages from 'requirements.txt'
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Install Flash-Attention
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

## 🚀 Inference

run the following command:
```bash
bash exps/inference_pixwizard.sh
```

## 🔥 Training

- **Prepare data**
  - First, refer to the provided [annotation_example](./configs/data/training_example.json) to prepare your own training dataset.
  - Second, refer to [s1.yaml](./configs/data/image2image_s1.yaml) and [s2.yaml](./configs/data/image2image_s1.yaml) to write your prepared annotation JSON.

- **Run training**
  - Place the downloaded weights for clip-vit-large-patch14-336 in the models/clip directory.
  - Update the model paths and data path in the [script](./exps) then run it.
