Predict the surface orientation of objects in the scene.
Generate a normal map to show the texture and depth variations in this image.
Process the image to create a normal map and show the simulated depth and texture.
Make a detailed normal map using the image's features and textures to simulate 3D surfaces.
Surface normal estimation
Estimate the surface normals.
Generate a normal map that accurately shows the surface angles and orientation details of the image.
Turn the image into a precise normal map to highlight surface normals for a 3D effect.
